This app loads a document about San Francisco food trucks, and allows the user to ask questions about the data. It uses the OpenAI API and several experimental features of the LangChain project to find relevant data points and answer the questions. 

This project can answer simple questions, but this technology really shines when loaded with a more robust data set. For example, if loaded with complicated financial data, it would allow the user to slice and dice the data to find insights and even create graphs in a fraction of the time of an entire team of financial analysts or data scientists.
